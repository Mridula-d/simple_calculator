ðŸ§® **Simple Calculator in Python**

This project is a console-based modular calculator developed in Python. It is designed to perform essential arithmetic and mathematical operations in a simple, structured, and reusable way. Unlike a single-file calculator, this project uses separate modules for each operation, making the code clean, modular, and easy to maintain or extend.

The calculator supports the following functionalities:

Addition â€“ implemented in add.py

Subtraction â€“ implemented in sub.py

Multiplication â€“ implemented in mul.py

Division â€“ implemented in div.py

Modulus Division â€“ implemented in modulousdiv.py

Power â€“ implemented in power.py

Square Root â€“ implemented in square_root.py

When you run the program, a menu-driven interface appears in the console. Users can select the required operation, provide two numbers as input, and instantly see the result. The program runs inside an infinite loop until the user chooses the exit option, making it convenient for repeated calculations.

Example Run
Welcome to Simple Calculator, I'm here to do 2 number operations

 1.add
 2.sub
 3.mul
 4.div
 5.modulousdiv
 6.power
 7.Square_root

Please select your operation: 3
enter num 1: 8
enter num 2: 7
Result: 56
